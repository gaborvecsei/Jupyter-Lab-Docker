# Jupyter Lab Docker Container

This is not a final solution and as it it said, it is not optimal also.

- Internet Connection is "hacky"
- Security Level is low (If I could call it even a level)
- Users are not separated (at least to groups)

## Usage

If you would like to install a python module or an apt package, please report it,
as the Dockerfile needs to be modified. Installing it directly inside the container is only
a temporary solution.

1. Create your own `work folder`
2. Create a personal copy of the `redvine` folder into your own folder (`cp -R redvine <YOUR_FOLDER>`)
3. Work inside your own folder & Enjoy

## Supported Languages

- Python 3.6
- R
